Modifications that change the meaning of the entry, or how it might be interpreted, should be marked with an importance of critical to bring it to the attention of anyone previously dependent on the weakness. The optional Contribution element is used to identify a contributor's name, organization, the date, and any related comments. This element has a single Type attribute, which indicates whether the contribution was part of general feedback given or actual content that was donated. The optional Previous_Entry_Name element is used to describe a previous name that was used for the entry. This should be filled out whenever a substantive name change occurs. The required Date attribute lists the date on which this name change was made. A Previous_Entry_Name element should align with a corresponding Modification element."

A value of Incomplete means that the entity does not have all important elements filled, and there is no guarantee of quality.  A value of Draft refers to an entity that has all important elements filled, and critical elements such as Name and Description are reasonably well-written; the entity may still have important problems or gaps.

In addition to graphs, a view can be a slice, which is a flat list of entries that does not specify any relationships between those entries. An explicit slice is a subset of weaknesses that are related through some external factor. For example, an explicit slice may be used to represent mappings to external groupings like a Top-N list.
