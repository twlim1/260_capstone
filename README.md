# DSE 260: Capstone Project
## Augmented Ontology for a Centralized Cyber Security Knowledge Graph

Cyber threats are constantly evolving. Currently, the rate at which cyber vulnerabilities are characterized is much slower than the rate at which they are exploited. Perception (searching for information), comprehension (understanding the situation), and prediction of dynamically evolving cybersecurity situations require a system that would allow cybersecurity practitioners to learn what the characteristics of any threat are, know how different threats are related, and what are the different situations that a threat can appear. Any such systemâ€™s knowledge base needs to be continually updated, assessed, and improved to cope with the dynamic nature of cybersecurity threats. This project aims to design and implement a system that will dynamically extract cybersecurity entities from text, characterize and augment the extracted information, organize in a cybersecurity knowledge graph (CKG), and provide a Query Answering interface for easy access to the information.
